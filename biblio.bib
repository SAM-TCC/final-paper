    abstract = "Background and objective
    The apnea syndrome is characterized by an abnormal breath pause or reduction in the airflow during sleep. It is reported in the literature that, it affects 2\% of middle-aged women and 4\% of middle-aged men, approximately. This study has vital importance, especially for the elderly, the disabled, and pediatric sleep apnea patients.
    Methods
    In this study, a device is developed to detect apnea events to alert the patient. The device records continuously accelerations on the diaphragm by using an acceleration sensor, which is placed on the patient's diaphragm. When the apnea is detected by the accelerometer-based system, a signal is sent to the wristband, and then the vibration motor on the wristband vibrates until the patient starts breathing again. The force of the vibration motor can be adjusted according to the patients' sleep debt, especially for elderly, disabled, or pediatric patients. There is no need for a sleeping room to see the patients' breathing properties since those parameters can be stored by using the developed device on a secure digital memory card (SD) at patients' homes during sleeping.
    Results
    A study group were formed of 10 patients (4 males (40\%) and 6 females (60\%)) with different characteristics ([mean] age, 36.3; height, 169.6 cm; and body weight, 81.4 kg). The patients in the study group have sleep apnea (SA). All the apnea events were detected, and all the patients were successfully alerted. Also, the lying position, which is a significant issue, is performed in this study.
    Conclusions
    This work proposed using an acceleration sensor as a reliable method of sleep apnea screening, detection of an apnea event, sending alert to the patient, and detection of the patient lying position. The developed device is more economical, comfortable, and convenient than existing systems for not only the patients but also the doctors. The patients can easily use this device in their home environment."

    abstract = {Background Recent research has found evidence of an association between motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) or near miss accidents (NMAs), and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) or its main medical cause, Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). However, EDS can also be due to non-medical factors, such as sleep debt (SD), which is common among professional truck drivers. On the opposite side, rest breaks and naps are known to protect against accidents.   Study Objectives To investigate the association of OSA, SD, EDS, rest breaks and naps, with the occurrence of MVAs and NMAs in a large sample of truck drivers.   Methods 949 male truck drivers took part in a cross-sectional medical examination and were asked to complete a questionnaire about sleep and waking habits, risk factors for OSA and EDS.   Results MVAs and NMAs were reported by 34.8\% and 9.2\% of participants, respectively. MVAs were significantly predicted by OSA (OR = 2.32 CI95\% = 1.68–3.20), SD (OR = 1.45 CI95\% = 1.29–1.63), EDS (OR = 1.73 CI95\% = 1.15–2.61) and prevented by naps (OR = 0.59 CI95\% = 0.44–0.79) or rest breaks (OR = 0.63 CI95\% = 0.45–0.89). NMAs were significantly predicted by OSA (OR = 2.39 CI95\% = 1.47–3.87) and SD (OR = 1.49 CI95\% = 1.27–1.76) and prevented by naps (OR = 0.52 CI95\% = 0.32–0.85) or rest breaks (OR = 0.49 CI95\% = 0.29–0.82).   Conclusions When OSA, SD or EDS are present, the risk of MVAs or NMAs in truck drivers is severely increased. Taking a rest break or a nap appear to be protective against accidents.},

    abstract={Sleep is a fundamental and vital physiological function. Getting enough quality sleep is necessary to a person's mental health, physiological well-being, quality of life, and safety. Sleep-disordered breathing, specifically obstructive sleep apnea can result in serious health issues, including hypertension and stroke. The current approaches for diagnosing sleep disorders are burdensome, intrusive, and can affect the patient's sleep quality. As a result, there is a crucial need for less cumbersome systems to diagnose sleep-related problems. In this paper, we evaluated the capacity of the microbend fiber optic sensor to monitor heart rate and respiration in a nonintrusive manner. In addition, we tested the capacity of the sensor in discriminating between shallow breathing and no breathing. The proposed sensor was compared with the three-channel portable monitoring device (ApneaLink) in a clinical setting during a drug-induced sleep endoscopy. Across all ten patients recruited for our study, the system achieved satisfactory results in the mean heart rate and the mean respiratory rate with an error of 0.55 ± 0.59 beats/minute and 0.38 ± 0.32 breaths/minute, respectively. Besides, the Pearson correlation coefficient between the proposed sensor and the reference device was 0.96 and 0.78 for heart rate and respiration, respectively. On the contrary, the proposed sensor provided a very low sensitivity (24.24 ± 12.81\%) and a relatively high specificity (85.88 ± 6.01\%) for sleep apnea detection. It is expected that this preliminary research will pave the way toward unobtrusive detection of vital signs in real time.},

    abstract={Obstructive sleep apnoea is one of the most common sleep disorders, which is characterized by the repetitive cessations of respiratory flow during sleep. This paper describes an alternative method to detect sleep parameters by measuring a variation in the earth's magnetic field. A magnetometer sensor, laid onto the body, detects millimeter night-time breathing movements by measuring the change in the magnetic vectors. A soft, non-invasive wearable sensor is designed to be printed on a miniature printed circuit board, packaged in a minimal invasive board, which includes a wireless Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) module and a low-power microcontroller. A very low power consumption is achieved by applying a smart processing algorithm, which is also described. The algorithm delivers respiration rate, apnoea time, and time in movement. A comparison with a well-known air-flow sensor is also discussed.},
